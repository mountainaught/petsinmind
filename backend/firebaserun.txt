# PetsInMind Backend – Setup Instructions

## Firebase Key
You must place the Firebase service account key at:

backend/src/main/resources/petsinmindkey.json --> rename the key to this

This file is not included in the repository. You need to:
- Generate it from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
- Or request it from the project owner

## How to Run


   cd petsinmind/backend

1. Build the project:
   ./gradlew build        (Linux/macOS)
   gradlew.bat build      (Windows)

2. Run the application:
   ./gradlew run
   or run Main.java manually in your IDE

If setup correctly, you should see console output confirming Firebase connection and test read/write actions.
